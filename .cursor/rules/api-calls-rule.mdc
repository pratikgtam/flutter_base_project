# API calls

- We are using Rest API as our backend service.
- After doing the api call always handle the error case by showing snackbar. No need to show snackbar for success unless its mentioned specifically.
- While loading, show proper state for eg: loading indicator while loading data. Button disabled while processing etc.
- For error handling use AppException
- always use listenWhen, eg: (previous, current) =>
            previous.signupResult != current.signupResult,
- create separate function for listener and listenWhen
- add logging in cubit for api calls (start, success, failure)
